      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/Smiles.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>I have a competitive nature and enjoy challenging myself. I've played tennis since I was seven years old and
        began coaching at sixteen.</p>

      <p>I played tennis at the collegiate level for four years where I earned the titles of Rookie of the Year, MVP,
        Captain and Player of the Year.</p>

      <p>Over the past three years I've had tough but amazing experiences as a coach for High School Junior Varisty
        Girls Tennis. Coaching a team of thirty-four girls taught me patience, flexibility in finding solutions and the
        importance of using small milestones when working towards a larger goal. I believe these attributes will help me
        with my future in the coding world.</p>
